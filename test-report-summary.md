## Recent Fixes Applied
In this feature branch (`feature/fix-filesystem-tools-tests`), we successfully fixed:

1. **DeleteFileTool** - Fixed path resolution, result data structures, and error handling
2. **MoveFileTool** - Fixed metadata handling, directory move logic, and error messages
3. **ListDirectoryTool** - Implemented strong typing with FileSystemEntry class, replaced dynamic usage

## Key Improvements Made
- Added `Message` property to ToolResult class
- Enhanced ToolResults helper methods
- Improved path resolution in file system tools
- Standardized error message formats
- Added proper WorkingDirectory support to all file system tool tests

## Next Steps
While we've successfully fixed all file system tool tests, there are still 99 failing tests in other categories that need attention. The main areas requiring fixes are:
- Text processing tools (FormatTextTool, ReplaceTextTool)
- Advanced features (ToolChain, caching, builders)
- Security and execution components
